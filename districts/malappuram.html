                <div style="text-align: justify; ">
                    <p> Bounded by the Nilgiris hills on the East and the Arabian Sea on the west, the district of Malappuram literally the land atop the hills, is remarkable for its unique natural beauty. Perched among the undulating hills and the meandering
                        rivers that flow to reach the coconut-fringed seacoast, the land conceals a unique and eventful history. The hill country also contributed much to the cultural artistic traditions of the state. The mosques and temples of the land
                        are known for their spectacular festivals. The land of great poets and writers, political and religious leaders, the district has carved a unique place of its own in the history of Kerala</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Home to the khilafath movement and the mappila revolts, which questioned the British authority in India, Malappuram was the military headquarters of the zamorins of Kozhikode since ancient times. Malappuram District was formed on 16th
                        of June 1969 with the Nilgiris of Tamilnadu in the east, Arabian sea in the west, Kozhikode and Wayanad Districts in the north and Palakkad and Thrissur District in the south. Best season to visit the district is between August
                        to November.

                    <p> Located 32 kms from Malappuram at Tirur is the hallowed Thunchan Parambu, the birth place of Thunchath Ezhuthachan, the father of Malayalam language. This stretch of ground has been carefully preserved for posterity with items like
                        the iron stylus used by the scholar and literary giant kept on display. The holy day of Vijayadasami witnesses children being brought here to be initiated into the world of education and knowledge The ancient kanjira tree (Nux
                        vomica) under which he is supposed to have imparted knowledge to his beloved disciples and composed his poems is one of the treasured exhibits here. The memorial also houses a granite Saraswathi Mandapam along with a library of
                        rare manuscripts.
