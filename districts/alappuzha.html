                <h3>Alappuzhha District Tourism</h3>
                <div><img src="../images/alappuzha1.jpeg" class="img-thumbnail"></div>
                <div style="text-align: justify;">
                    <p> The name Alappuzha is derived from Aal (Sea)+ puzhai (River-mouth) ("The joining place of a river and the sea") (Malayalam/Tamil ). Alappuzha is one of the most important tourist centres in the state, with a large network of inland
                        canals, earning it the sobriquet "Venice of the East". These large networks of canals are Alleppey's lifeline. Alappuzha was one of the busiest centers of trade in the past, with one of the best-known ports along the Malabar coast.
                        Even today it retains its charm as the center for the Coir carpet industry and prawn farming. Alappuzha, the ideal headquarters for backwater tourism, as well as for visits to the church-filled town of Kottayam and the town of
                        Aranmula, which are known for their historic annual Aranmula Snake Boat Race. Chengannur, in Alappuzha, is the nearest railway station to Sabarimala. The Krishnapuram Palace is in Kayamkulam. The Buddha idol and Saradha Mandiram
                        are the main attractions of Mavelikkara. The Buddha statue is in a seated posture, resembling Padmasana. A feature common to the idols is that hair has not been engraved on the head. Studies by the archaeology department have not
                        been able to explain the absence of hair, which is common to Buddha statues of the Gandhara and Mathura traditions. The head has markings resembling headgear. Though the department has made a pagoda-like structure for the statue,
                        no information on the idol is available to tourists who visit the area. Local people in the area light lamps before the idol. The idol at Mavelikara is 4 feet (1.2 m) high and is perhaps the biggest. The engravings on the head
                        resemble a helmet of Greek statues. The mark of a sacred thread is visible on the body. Another feature is the marking of a shawl on one shoulder. Here the archaeological department has put up a sign specifying the age of the statue.
                        Saradha Mandiram was the residence of Kerala Panini. </p>

                    <p>Kuttanad or Kuttanadu is an area of Alappuzha District, densely covered with waterways. Kuttanad is famous[citation needed] because of its paddy fields and farmers dedicated to the growth of paddy.[citation needed] It was once called
                        the "Keralathinte Nellara", which means "rice bowl of Kerala". Factors such as expense and labor shortages affected the agriculture in this region.[citation needed] Many former rice fields are now used for other crops which require
                        much lesser investment. Kuttanadu is the birthplace of the novelist Thakazhi Sivasankara Pillai. </p>
