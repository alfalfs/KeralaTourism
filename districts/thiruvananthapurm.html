                <div style="text-align: justify; ">
                    <p> The southernmost district of Kerala is Thiruvananthapuram and is the capital city. Thiruvananthapuram is surrounded by Tamil Nadu state in the East, Arabian Sea in the South and West and Kollam district in the North. The word Thiruvananthapuram
                        is derived from Thiru-anantha-puram which means the home of Lord Ananta. Ananta is the serpent and is a deity in a temple in Thiruvananthapuram. The district is also referred as Trivandrum in English.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Long before the Independence, Thiruvananthapuram was the capital of the Travancore state. The geographic feature of the area is classified as highlands, midlands and lowlands. There are areas in the coastal part where cliffs are present
                        instead of flat area and are found in Varkala. The second highest peak of Western Ghats called the Agasthyarkoodam peak is in Thiruvananthapuram. Some of the rivers that flow through this state are Neyyar River, Karamana River
                        and Vamanapuram River. Besides, there are many lakes and backwaters also.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p> Tourism is a major sector of Thiruvananthapuram's economy. A full range of tourist options is available in the district, including hill stations, the Kerala backwaters, beaches, lagoons, and wildlife sanctuaries. Kovalam and its internationally
                        known beaches are in Thiruvananthapuram district. Thiruvananthapuram is a major destination for chartered flights to India for medical tourism, with over fifty recognized Ayurveda centres in and around the city. The city also offers
                        world-class modern hospitals. Convalescent facilities are available at nearby five-star beach resorts and hill stations.

                <h4>Kovalam Beach</h4>

                <div style="text-align: justify; ">
                    <p> Kovalam has three beaches separated by rocky outcroppings in its 17 km coastline, the three together form the famous crescent of the Kovalam beach.[4] Lighthouse Beach The southernmost beach, the Lighthouse Beach is the one most frequented
                        by tourists, Lighthouse Beach got its name due to the old Vizhinjam Lighthouse located on a 35 meter high on top of the Kurumkal hillock. The lighthouse is built using stones, is colored in red and white bands and enjoys a height
                        of 118 feet.[5] It's intermittent beams at night render the beach with an unearthly charm.[6] Hawah Beach Eveâ€™s Beach, more commonly known as Hawa Beach, ranks second, in the early day, is a beehive of activities with fishermen
                        setting out for sea. With a high rock promontory and a calm bay of blue waters, this beach paradise creates a unique aquarelle on moonlit nights. Samudra Beach A large promontory separates this part from the southern side. Samudra
                        Beach doesn't have tourists thronging there or hectic business. The local fishermen ply their trade on this part. Detour past Kovalam junction to land on Samudra Beach which is to the north of Ashoka Beach. One has the option to
                        walk along the sea-wall too. The sight of the waves lashing on the rocks below is awesome. Shallow waters stretching for hundreds of metres are ideal for swimming. The beaches have steep palm covered headlands and are lined with
                        shops that offer all kinds of goods and services.[7] Evening time view of the beach The larger of the beaches is called Lighthouse Beach for its 35 meters high lighthouse which towers over it atop Kurumkal hillock. The second largest
                        one is Hawah Beach named thus for the topless European women who used to throng there. It was the first topless beach in India.[citation needed] However topless bathing is banned now except in private coves owned by resorts. Visitors
                        frequent these two beaches. The northern part of the beach is known as Samudra Beach in tourism parlance. A large promontory separates this part from the southern side. Samudra Beach doesn't have tourists thronging there or hectic
                        business. The local fishermen ply their trade on this part. The sands on the beaches in Kovalam are partially black in colour due to the presence of ilmenite and Monazite. The normal tourist season is from September to May. Ashoka
                        beach is also the part of Kovalam beach.

                <h4>Thiruvananthapuram Zoo</h4>

                    <p> Thiruvananthapuram Zoo is one of the oldest Zoo in India. Similarly the Museum and Botanical Gardens are also one of the oldest of their kind in the country. Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma,(1816-1846), illustrious King and Music composer
                        who had ruled Travancore during 1830-1846 was the visionary behind the establishment of the Thiruvananthapuram Museum and Zoo,He had a good collection of animals including elephants in his horse breeding centre. To the Trivandrum
                        stables he incorporated a menagerie and kept tigers, panthers cheetahs, deer, bears and a lioness there. It was however left to his brother Uthram Thirunal Marthanda Varma and the then British Resident General Cullen which resulted
                        in the establishment of Napier Museum and Zoo in Thiruvananthapuram. A committee was formed in 1855 with the Maharaja of Travancore as Patron, General Cullen as President, The Elaya Raja as Vice President and Mr. Allen Brown as
                        Secretary of the Committee and the Director of Museum. The Museum was thrown open to the Public in September 1857. But the Museum by itself could not attract the people much, and therefore a Zoo and a park were started in 1859.The
                        zoo was originally built with the typical iron-barred cages prevalent at the time, and was designed for recreational purposes, but with increased loss of forest and wildlife due to human development, the goal of the Zoo has changed
                        from recreation to conservation. Asiatic lions in Thiruvananthapuram Zoo Asiatic lions in Thiruvananthapuram Zoo A modernization project started in 1995, aims to gradually replace the old enclosures with spacious naturalistic enclosures.
                        The state government of Kerala is undertaking this renovation with financial and technical help from the Central Zoo Authority.</p>
