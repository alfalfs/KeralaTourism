                    <h3>Idukki District Tourism</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p> Idukki is a district in the Indian state of Kerala.[1] It was constituted on 26 January 1972, by splitting the district of Kottayam into two parts. Its division was earlier headquartered at Kottayam city, but moved to Painavu in June
                        1976. Idukki district lies amid the Western Ghats of Kerala. Though it is regarded as the second-largest district in the region, it has the lowest population density among the districts of Kerala,[2] the urban population being
                        higher than the rural. Idukki is rich in forests and also known as the "Spice Garden of Kerala". </p>

                <h4>Munnar</h4>

                <div style="text-align: justify; ">
                    <p>Munnar was the summer resort of the British Government in the south. The town is situated at the convergence of three mountain streams, namely Muthirappuzha, Nallathanni, and Kundala. Munnar has some of the largest tea plantations
                        in the world. This hill station, which is more than 5,000 feet above sea level, is a tourist attraction noted for its scenic landscapes. Most of the native flora and fauna of Munnar have disappeared due to severe habitat fragmentation
                        resultant from the creation of the plantations. However, some species continue to survive and thrive in several protected areas nearby, including the new Kurinjimala Sanctuary to the east, the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary, Manjampatti
                        Valley, and the Amaravati reserve forest of Indira Gandhi Wildlife Sanctuary to the northeast, the Eravikulam National Park and Anamudi Shola National Park in the north, and the Pampadum Shola National Park to the south. The Palani
                        Hills National Park is proposed to come up to the east of Idukki. These protected areas are especially known for several threatened and endemic species including the Nilgiri tahr, the grizzled giant squirrel, the Nilgiri wood-pigeon,
                        the elephant, the gaur, the Nilgiri langur, the sambar, and the neelakurinji (that blossoms only once in twelve years). The former Kunda Valley Railway in Munnar was destroyed by a flood in 1924, but tourism officials are considering
                        reconstructing the railway line to attract tourists. </p>

                    <p>Vagamon is a hill station situated 1,200 meters above sea level, 37 km from Pala and 42 km from Thodupuzha. This hill station provides options of trekking, para gliding or rock climbing for adventure-seekers, and has many varieties
                        of flora and fauna. Evergreen trees, tall grasses, and shrubs are present in the lower regions of Vagamon. Many rare species of birds, insects, wild buffaloes, and elephants can be easily located in the forests. The main attractions
                        here are mist-covered mountains and lakes, pilgrim centers (Kurishumala, Murugan temple, and burial chamber of a Sufi saint), and pine forests.
