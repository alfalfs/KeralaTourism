                <div><img src="../images/ernakulam1.jpg" class="img-thumbnail"></div>
                <div style="text-align: justify;">
                    <p> Ernakulam, the commercial capital of Kerala, served by an international airport, fine communication facilities, excellent accommodation, modern amenities and a lot of attractive tourist places gives a breathtaking experience for its
                        visitors and settlers. The district took its form on 1st April 1958, by carving out the areas of erstwhile Travancore, Kochi & Malabar kingdoms. The word Ernakulam was derived from a Tamil word 'Erayanarkulam' which means 'Lord
                        Shiva's abode'.The commercial capital of Kerala and the most cosmopolitan of Kerala's cities, Cochin is a fascinating blend of cultures. From time immemorial, it has been the favorite destination of globe-trotters and explorers.
                        Blessed by one of the finest natural harbors in the world, Cochin has been eulogised as the Queen of the Arabian Sea.In and around Cochin are several cities of monumental value, but step into Fort Cochin, and you are in a totally
                        different world. The Chinese fishing nets, the Jewish Synagogue, the Dutch palace, the Portuguese and British Architecture, all are the unique features of Kochi.</p>

                    <p>The flora of this district is tropical. The heavy rainfall combined with moderate temperature and fertile soil support abundant vegetation. Many of the common plants are found in the coastal area, which forms the low land region. Coconut
                        is extensively cultivated here. The midland region is mainly occupied by coconut palms. Paddy, tapioca, pepper, pineapple and pulses are also cultivated here. The lower slopes of the highland region are under teak, and rubber cultivation.
                        The eastern part of the district has dense forests with its characteristic fauna. </p>
